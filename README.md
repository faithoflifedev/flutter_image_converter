Well-tested and easy-to-use Dart & Flutter image transformer package: ui, widgets, [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image), ImageProvider, bytes, and base64 string.
Works in any direction as extension.
**You no longer have to worry about writing code to convert images in different formats.**
Feel free to use it in your awesome project.

Share some ❤️ and star repo to support the project.

## Usage

### Raw bytes from File to Flutter Widget

```dart
File('1.jpg').widgetImage
```

Can detect [all formats](https://github.com/brendan-duncan/image/blob/main/doc/formats.md) from the package image.

### ImageProvider to UI Widget

```dart
await AssetImage('1.jpg').uiImage
```

### Package Image to Flutter Widget

```dart
Image(...).widgetImage
```

### ImageProvider to PNG raw bytes

```dart
AssetImage('nature.webp').pngUint8List
```

### File to PNG raw bytes

```dart
File('nature.webp').pngUint8List
```

Supports the image providers:

- `AssetImage`
- `FileImage`
- `MemoryImage`
- `NetworkImage`
- any providers from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages?q=image+provider) inherited from `ImageProvider`

See folders `example` and `test` for more use cases.

## Available Converters

```dart
import 'dart:ui' as ui;
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart' as widget;
import 'package:image/image.dart' as image;
```
